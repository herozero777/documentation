# Setup

## Getting Started

The following sections will walk you through updating your Nerves project to work with the [nerves-hub.org](https://nerves-hub.org) NervesHub server. For connecting to your own NervesHub or another location, look at [`Setup: Connecting to other environments`](connecting-other-envs.md) first, then continue from here.

Many of the following steps may feel manual, but they can and are automated by NervesHub users to set up automatic firmware updates from CI and to manufacture large numbers of devices.
